    <p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>
    <p>
      The paragraph tag helps divide content into manageable, readable sections.
    </p>

    <!-- Break Tag -->
        <p>
        This paragraph has multiple
        <br>lines. But HTML reduces them
        <br>to a single line, omitting
        <br>the carriage return we have used.
